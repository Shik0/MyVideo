Download stream video from myvideo.az.

The project is in "half-working" status. It means that, in current status we can download videos from myvideo.az streaming portal. But, login and register forms are not work yet.

Will be updated soon.

To download video we need four parameters:
  * TV channel name
  * TV program's (video) date
  * Start time
  * End time

  After clicking to Download button the selected video will be downloaded.
